Optimus SDK libs
=================

This package provides the `sdk` package which contains code useful for
developing Optimus plugins.

Although we try not to break functionality, we reserve the right to reorganize
the code at will and may occasionally cause breaks if they are warranted. As
such we expect the tag of this module will stay less than `v1.0.0`.
