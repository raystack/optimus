# Contributing

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŒŸðŸ¥³

Before start contributing, feel free to ask questions or initiate conversation via GitHub discussion.
You are also welcome to create issue if you encounter a bug or to suggest feature enhancements.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Best practices

- Follow the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format for all commit messages.
- Link the PR with the issue. This is mandatory to ensure there is sufficient information for the reviewer to understand
  your PR.
- When you make a PR for small change (such as fixing a typo, style change, or grammar fix), please squash your commits
  so that we can maintain a cleaner git history.
- Docs live in the code repo under [docs](https://github.com/raystack/optimus/tree/main/docs). Please maintain the docs
  and any docs changes can be done in the same PR.
- Avoid force-pushing as it makes reviewing difficult.

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the project
