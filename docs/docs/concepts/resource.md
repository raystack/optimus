# Resource

A resource is the representation of the warehouse unit that can be a source or a destination of a transformation job. 
The warehouse resources can be created, modified, and be read from Optimus, as well as can be backed up as requested. 
Each warehouse supports a fixed set of resource types and each type has its own specification schema. 
Optimusâ€™ managed warehouse  is called Optimus datastore.

At the moment, Optimus supports BigQuery datastore for these type of resources:
- Dataset
- Table
- Standard View
- External Table

_Note: BigQuery resource deletion is currently not supported._
