# Namespace

A namespace represents a grouping of specified jobs and resources which are accessible only through the namespace owners. 
You may override the project configuration or define the configuration locally at the namespace level. A namespace always 
belongs to a Project. All Namespaces of a Project share the same infrastructure and the Scheduler.
